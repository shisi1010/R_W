RAW THOUGHT  by Aaron Swartz “散乱的思考” 

## HOWTO: Be more productive
如何更有成效

“With all the time you spend watching TV,” he tells me, “you could have written a novel by now.” It’s hard to disagree with the sentiment — writing a novel is undoubtedly a better use of time than watching TV — but what about the hidden assumption? Such comments imply that time is “fungible” — that time spent watching TV can just as easily be spent writing a novel. And sadly, that’s just not the case.

有人对我说，“你花在看电视上的时间，加起来到现在都可以写一本小说了。” 很难不同意这种观点，写小说无疑比看电视更好地利用时间，但这个假设是否有一个隐藏的前提？这样的评论意味着时间是“可以替代”的 - 即看电视的时间被用在写小说上也很一样轻松。令人遗憾的是，事实并非如此。

Time has various levels of quality. If I’m walking to the subway station and I’ve forgotten my notebook, then it’s pretty hard for me to write more than a couple paragraphs. And it’s tough to focus when you keep getting interrupted. There’s also a mental component: sometimes I feel happy and motivated and ready to work on something, but other times I feel so sad and tired I can only watch TV.

时间有各种各样的质量水平。比如我正在走到地铁站，身上忘带了笔记本，那么想记下几段话就相当困难。同理当你不断被打扰时，你就很难专注做某些事。同时还有一些主观上的原因：比如有时我感到愉快，那么我就会有动力然后准备好去做某些事情，但是有时我感到非常伤心和疲惫，那么我只能看电视。

If you want to be more productive then, you have to recognize this fact and deal with it. First, you have to make the best of each kind of time. And second, you have to try to make your time higher-quality.

如果你想要变得更有效率，你必须认识到这个事实并解决它。首先，你必须充分利用每一种时间。其次，你必须努力让你的时间更有质量。

## Spend time efficiently 有效地利用时间

#### Choose good problems 选择一些好问题

Life is short (or so I’m told) so why waste it doing something dumb? It’s easy to start working on something because it’s convenient, but you should always be questioning yourself about it. Is there something more important you can work on? Why don’t you do that instead? Such questions are hard to face up to (eventually, if you follow this rule, you’ll have to ask yourself why you’re not working on the most important problem in the world) but each little step makes you more productive.

人生苦短（正如我常说的那样）所以为何要在那些蠢事上浪费宝贵的时间呢？*开始去做一些事情总是简单的，因为这很方便*，但是你应该经常自省: 是否有一些更重要的事情值得你去做？为什么你不先去做那些?这些问题总是很难去面对（事实上，如果你牢牢遵循这个规则,你会想为何自己不去解决这个世界上最重要的问题），但每一小步都能让你的工作更有成效。

This isn’t to say that all your time should be spent on the most important problem in the world. Mine certainly isn’t (after all, I’m writing this essay). But it’s definitely the standard against which I measure my life.

这并不是说所有的时间都应该花在世界上最重要的问题上。我自己都当然不是这样的（毕竟，我正在写这篇文章）。 但这绝对就是我自己衡量自己生活的标准。

#### Have a bunch of them 将他们归之一束

Another common myth is that you’ll get more done if you pick one problem and focus on it exclusively. I find this is hardly ever true. Just this moment for example, I’m trying to fix my posture, exercise some muscles, drink some fluids, clean off my desk, IM with my brother, and write this essay. Over the course the day, I’ve worked on this essay, read a book, had some food, answered some email, chatted with friends, done some shopping, worked on a couple other essays, backed up my hard drive, and organized my book list. In the past week I’ve worked on several different software projects, read several different books, studied a couple different programming languages, moved some of my stuff, and so on.

另一个常见的(鸡汤)神话是，如果你选择一个问题并专注于这个问题，你最终会得到更多收获。我觉得这是不现实的。例如，就像现在,我试图修正我的坐姿，锻炼一些肌肉，喝一些液体，清理我的书桌，与我的兄弟即时聊天(IM)，同时写这篇文章。 在这一天的过程中，我已经写了这篇文章，读了一本书，吃了一些食物，回复了一些电子邮件，和朋友聊天，购了一些物，写了一些其他的文章，备份了我的硬盘，并罗列了我的书目清单。 在过去一周里，我一直在做几个不同的软件项目，阅读几本不同的书籍，学习了几种不同的编程语言，移动了我的一些东西，诸如此类。

Having a lot of different projects gives you work for different qualities of time. Plus, you’ll have other things to work on if you get stuck or bored (and that can give your mind time to unstick yourself).

你会有不同质量的时间去做很多不同(难度)的项目工作。另外，当你陷入困境或者感到无聊时，你应该去处理其他的事情（这样可以让你的头脑有时间自我解放）。

It also makes you more creative. Creativity comes from applying things you learn in other fields to the field you work in. If you have a bunch of different projects going in different fields, then you have many more ideas you can apply.

这也会让你变得更富有创造力。创造力来自于将你在其他领域学到的东西运用到你工作的领域。如果你有几个在不同领域的不同项目，那么你应该去应用更多的想法于项目中。

#### Make a list 制作一个清单
Coming up with a bunch of different things to work on shouldn’t be hard — most people have tons of stuff they want to get done. But if you try to keep it all in your head it quickly gets overwhelming. The psychic pressure of having to remember all of it can make you crazy. The solution is again simple: write it down.

要做好一些不同的事情不应该很难 - 大多数人都有很多想做的事情。 但是，如果你想把它们全部放在脑海中，它们就会变成压力。不得不记住所有这些的心理压力会让你发疯。 解决办法很简单：写下来。

Once you have a list of all the things you want to do, you can organize it by kind. For example, my list is programming, writing, thinking, errands, reading, listening, and watching (in that order).

一旦你有了所有你想要做的事情的列表，你可以按照种类来组织它们。 例如，我的名单是编程，写作，思考，差事，阅读，听和看（按此顺序）。

Most major projects involve a bunch of these different tasks. Writing this, for example, involves reading about other procrastination systems, thinking up new sections of the article, cleaning up sentences, emailing people with questions, and so on, all in addition to the actual work of writing the text. Each task can go under the appropriate section, so that you can do it when you have the right kind of time.

大多数重大项目都涉及到这些不同的任务。 例如，写这些文字，除了写作文本的工作之外，还包括阅读其他相关于拖延系统(的文章)，思考文章的新部分，清理句子，向读者发问等等。 每个任务都可以在适当的部分进行，这样，在适当的时间时，你就可以做到这一点。

#### Integrate the list with your life 将列表整合进你的生活
Once you have this list, the problem becomes remembering to look at it. And the best way to remember to look at it is to make looking at it what you would do anyway. For example, I keep a stack of books on my desk, with the ones I’m currently reading on top. When I need a book to read, I just grab the top one off the stack.

一旦你有这个列表，问题就变成了记住经常去看看它。 记住看它的最好方法就是看看你会做什么。 例如，我在我的桌子上放着一堆书，我正在读顶部的书。 当我需要一本书来阅读的时候，我只需要从书堆中拿出一本。

I do the same thing with TV/movies. Whenever I hear about a movie I should watch, I put it in a special folder on my computer. Now whenever I feel like watching TV, I just open up that folder.


我在看电视或电影时也做同样的事情。每当我被安利了一部我应该去看的电影，我会把它放在我的电脑上的一个特殊的文件夹。 现在每当我想看电视的时候，我就会打开那个文件夹。

I’ve also thought about some more intrusive ways of doing this. For example, a web page that pops up with a list of articles in my “to read” folder whenever I try to check some weblogs. Or maybe even a window that pops up with work suggestions occasionally for me to see when I’m goofing off.

我也想过一些更有干扰性的做法。 例如，每当我尝试检查一些网络日志时，在我的“阅读”文件夹中会弹出一个文章列表的网页。 或者甚至偶尔出现一些窗口，会提出工作建议，以便我看清楚什么时候我会在休假。

#### Make your time higher quality 使你的时间具有更高质量

Making the best use of the time you have can only get you so far. The much more important problem is making more higher quality time for yourself. Most people’s time is eaten up by things like school and work. Obviously if you attend one of these, you should stop. But what else can you do?

到目前为止,(这篇文章)只能让你充分利用你的时间。 更重要的问题是为自己创造更多更高质量的时间。 大多数人的时间被学校和工作等东西吃掉了。显然，如果你是其中一个，你应该停止。 但你还能做什么呢？

## Ease physical constraints 减少物理上的限制
#### Carry pen and paper 随身携带笔和纸
Pretty much everyone interesting I know has some sort of pocket notebook they carry at all times. Pen and paper is immediately useful in all kinds of circumstances — if you need to write something down for somebody, take notes on something, scratch down an idea, and so on. I’ve even written whole articles in the subway.

我知道几乎每个随身携带一些口袋笔记本的人都很有趣。在一些情况下笔和纸都很有用 - 如果您需要为某人写下某些东西，记下某件事情，划掉一个想法，等等。我甚至在地铁里写了整篇文章。

(I used to do this, but now I just carry my computerphone everywhere. It doesn’t let me give people information physically, but it makes up for it by giving me something to read all the time (email) and pushing my notes straight into my email inbox, where I’m forced to deal with them right away.)

（我曾经这样做过，但是现在我只随身携带我的电脑。这样虽然不能在物理上更直观的将信息传达给他人，但是通过其他的一些手段（例如电子邮件）并能直接推送我的笔记到我的电子邮件收件箱让我能马上处理它们，这样来弥补它的不足）

#### Avoid being interrupted 避免被打断
For tasks that require serious focus, you should avoid getting interrupted. One simple way is to go somewhere interrupters can’t find you. Another is to set up an agreement with the people around you: “don’t bother me when the door is closed” or “IM me if I have headphones on” (and then you can ignore the IMs until you’re free).

对于需要重点关注的任务，应避免中断。一个简单的方法是去某个地方让能打扰你的人找不到你。另一个方法是是与周围的人订一个协议：“关门时不要打扰我”，或者“如果我有耳机，就打电话给我”（然后你可以忽略即时消息直到你有空）。

You don’t want to overdo it. Sometimes if you’re really wasting time you should be distracted. It’s a much better use of time to help someone else with their problem than it is to sit and read the news. That’s why setting up specific agreements is a good idea: you can be interrupted when you’re not really focusing.

你也不应该做过头。有时如果你真的在浪费时间，你应该分心去做其他的是。比如帮助别人解决问题就比坐下来阅读新闻要好得多。这就是为什么制定具体的协议是一个好主意：当你没有专注时，你可能会被打断。

## Ease mental constraints 放松心理上的约束
#### Eat, sleep, exercise 吃，睡，锻炼
Time when you’re hungry or tired or twitchy is low-quality time. Improving it is simple: eat, sleep, and exercise. Yet I somehow manage to screw up even this. I don’t like going to get food, so I’ll often work right through being hungry and end up so tired out that I can’t bring myself to go get food.

饥饿或疲倦或焦躁的时候是低质量的时间。改善它们很简单：吃，睡，锻炼。然而，虽然这样说，我自己也搞砸了。我不喜欢吃东西，所以我经常饿着肚子工作，结果累得不行。

It’s tempting to say to yourself, “I know I’m tired but I can’t take a nap — I have work to do”. In fact, you’ll be much more productive if you do take that nap, since you’ll improve the quality of the day’s remaining time and you were going to have to sleep sometime anyway.


对自己说：“我知道我累了，但我不能小睡 - 我有工作要做。”这样很有迷惑性。事实上，如果你休息一下，你会更有效率，因为这样会提高剩余时间的质量，所以无论如何你都应该保证充足睡眠。

I don’t really exercise much so I’m probably not the best person to give advice on that bit, but I do try to work it in where I can. While I’m lying down reading, I do situps. And when I need to go somewhere on foot, I run.

我真的没有做过太多的运动，所以我可能不是合适的提供这个建议的人。但我确实尽力在我能做到的地方运动了。比如我做了仰卧起坐当我躺着读书时，我跑了步当我需要步行去某个地方时。

#### Talk to cheerful people 和开朗的人交谈
Easing mental constraints is much harder. One thing that helps is having friends who are cheerful. For example, I always find myself much more inclined to work after talking to Paul Graham or Dan Connolly — they just radiate energy. It’s tempting to think that you need to get away from people and shut yourself off in your room to do any real work, but this can be so demoralizing that it’s actually less efficient.

放松心理上的约束是非常困难的。有一个开心的朋友是很有用的。例如，我发现自己在与保罗·格雷厄姆（Paul Graham）和丹·康诺利（Dan Connolly）交谈之后总是更倾向于工作 - 他们会放出正能量。有时想想你远离人们，把自己关在房间里去做任何工作，这是很有诱惑力的，但是这可能导致士气低落，实际上效率较低。

#### Share the load 和他人分享你的压力
Even if your friends aren’t cheerful, just working on a hard problem with someone else makes it much easier. For one thing, the mental weight gets spread across both people. For another, having someone else there forces you to work instead of getting distracted.

即使你的朋友也不开心，只要和其他人一起解决一个难题，也会让你更轻松。一方面，压力均分给了两个人。另一方面，有别人在那里强迫你工作就不容易分心了。

#### Procrastination and the mental force field 拖延症和精神上的其他力量
But all of this is sort of dodging the issue. The real productivity problem people have is procrastination. It’s something of a dirty little secret, but everyone procrastinates — severely. It’s not just you. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to stop it.

但上述的所有方法这一切都是在回避这个问题。人们真正的生产力最大对头是拖延症。这是一个肮脏的小秘密，但每个人都拖延 - 还很严重。这不只是你。但这并不意味着你不应该去试图阻止它。

What is procrastination? To the outside observer, it looks like you’re just doing something “fun” (like playing a game or reading the news) instead of doing your actual work. (This usually causes the outside observer to think you’re lazy and bad.) But the real question is: what’s going on inside your head?

什么是拖延？对于外部的观察者来说，看起来你只是在做一些“有趣的事情”（比如玩游戏或者阅读新闻），而不是做一些实际的工作。 （这通常会导致外部观察者认​​为你是懒惰和坏）。但真正的问题在于：你脑子里发生了什么？

I’ve spent a bunch of time trying to explore this and the best way I can describe it is that your brain puts up a sort of mental force field around a task. Ever play with two magnets? If you orient the magnets properly and try to push them towards each other, they’ll repel fiercely. As you move them around, you can sort of feel out the edges of the magnetic field. And as you try to bring the magnets together, the field will push you back or off in another direction.

我花了一大堆时间来探索这个，我能够进行最好的描述的方式就是你的大脑围绕着一个任务建立一种精神力场。你是否曾经玩过两个磁铁？如果你正确地放好磁铁，并试图将它们推向对方，它们将会猛烈地排斥。当你移动它们时，你可以感觉到磁场的边缘。当你试图把磁铁放在一起时，磁场会把你推向另一个方向。

The mental block seems to work in the same way. It’s not particularly solid or visible, but you can sort of feel it around the edges. And the more you try to go towards it the more it pushes you away. And so, not surprisingly, you end up going in another direction.3

心理障碍似乎也是以同样的方式工作的。它不是特别突出或可见，但你可以感觉到它周围的边缘。你越试图走向它时就越是把你推开。 所以，毫不惊奇，你最终会走向另一个方向

And just as you can’t get two repelling magnets to sit together just by pushing real hard — they’ll fling back as soon as you stop pushing — I’ve never been able to overcome this mental force field through sheer willpower. Instead, you have to be sneaky about it — you have to rotate a magnet.

而正如你不能将两个排斥的磁铁一起吸在一起 - 他们就会在你停止推动的时候马上回来 - 我从来没有能够通过纯粹的意志力克服这个精神力量领域。 相反，你必须偷偷摸摸的 - 去旋转磁铁。

So what causes the mental force field? There appear to be two major factors: whether the task is hard and whether it’s assigned.

那么什么导致了这种精神力场的存在？ 似乎有两个主要因素：任务是否困难以及是否分配好了。

## Hard problems 大问题
#### Break it down 击碎它
The first kind of hard problem is the problem that’s too big. Say you want to build a recipe organizing program. Nobody can really just sit down and build a recipe organizer. That’s a goal, not a task. A task is a specific concrete step you can take towards your goal. A good first task might be something like “draw a mockup of the screen that displays a recipe”. Now that’s something you can do.4

第一类难题是个很大的问题。假设你想建立一个食谱组织程序。没有人可以坐下来马上建立一个食谱组织器。这是一个目标，而不是一个任务。任务是您可以朝着目标迈出的具体步骤。现在，一个首要任务可能就是“画一个配方的屏幕模型”，这是你可以做的事情。

And when you do that, the next steps become clearer. You have to decide what a recipe consists of, what kind of search features are needed, how to structure the recipe database, and so on. You build up a momentum, each task leading to the next. And as your brain gets crunching on the subject, it becomes easier to solve that subject’s problems.

而当你这样做时，下一步就会变得更加清晰。你必须决定配方的模型，需要什么类型的搜索功能，如何构建配方数据库，等等。你起了一个势头，每个任务推动下一个。随着你的大脑在这个问题上的磨合，解决这个问题变得更容易。

For each of my big projects, I think of all the tasks I can do next for them and add them to my categorized todo list (see above). And when I stop working on something, I add its next possible tasks to the todo list.

对于我的每一个大项目，我想到了我可以为他们做的所有任务，并将其添加到我的分类待办事项列表（请参阅上文）。当我停止工作时，我会将其下一个可能的任务添加到待办事项列表中。

#### Simplify it 简化它
Another kind of hard problem is the one that’s too complicated or audacious. Writing a book seems daunting, so start by doing an essay. If an essay is too much, start by writing a paragraph summary. The important thing is to have something done right away.

另一个棘手的问题是目标太复杂或太大胆。写一本书似乎令人望而生畏，所以从写一篇文章开始吧。如果一篇文章太多，那就先写一个段落摘要。重要的是要立刻完成一些事情。

Once you have something, you can judge it more accurately and understand the problem better. It’s also much easier to improve something that already exists than to work at a blank page. If your paragraph goes well, then maybe it can grow into an essay and then into a book, little by little, a perfectly reasonable piece of writing all the way through..

一旦你有了一些东西，你可以更准确地判断后续问题，并更好地理解问题。改善已经存在的东西比在空白页面上工作要容易得多。如果你写段落顺利，那么也许它可以成长为一篇文章，然后通过合理的写作一点一点成为一本书。

#### Think about it 思考它
Often the key to solving a hard problem will be getting some piece of inspiration. If you don’t know much about the field, you should obviously start by researching it — see how other people did things, get a sense of the terrain. Sit and try and understand the field fully. Do some smaller problems to see if you have a handle on it.

解决困难问题的关键在于得到一些启发。如果你对这个领域了解不多，你应该从研究它开始 - 看看其他人做了什么事，了解形式。请坐下来，充分了解这个领域。做一些较小的问题，看看你是否有能力处理它。

## Assigned problems 指定问题
Assigned problems are problems you’re told to work on. Numerous psychology experiments have found that when you try to “incentivize” people to do something, they’re less likely to do it and do a worse job. External incentives, like rewards and punishments, kills what psychologists call your “intrinsic motivation” — your natural interest in the problem. (This is one of the most thoroughly replicated findings of social psychology — over 70 studies have found that rewards undermine interest in the task.)5 People’s heads seem to have a deep avoidance of being told what to do.

指定问题是指你应该要处理的问题。许多心理学实验发现，当你试图“激励”人们做某事时，他们不太可能做的到这一点，或者做得更差。奖励和惩罚等外在激励措施会杀死心理学家称之为“内在动机”的东西 - 你对问题的自然兴趣。 （这是社会心理学最彻底复制的结果之一 - 有70多项研究发现，奖励会削弱对这项任务的兴趣。）人们的头脑似乎被很大程度地习惯避免被告知要做什么。

The weird thing is that this phenomenon isn’t just limited to other people — it even happens when you try to tell yourself what to do! If you say to yourself, “I should really work on X, that’s the most important thing to do right now” then all of the sudden X becomes the toughest thing in the world to make yourself work on. But as soon as Y becomes the most important thing, the exact same X becomes much easier.

奇怪的是，这种现象不仅仅局限于其他人，甚至在你试图告诉自己该做什么的时候也会发生。如果你对自己说，“我真的应该在X上工作，这是现在最重要的事情”，那么突然之间X会成为世界上最难做的事情。但是，一旦Y成为最重要的事情，那么完全相同的X就会变得更容易。

#### Create a false assignment 创建一个虚假的作业
This presents a rather obvious solution: if you want to work on X, tell yourself to do Y. Unfortunately, it’s sort of difficult to trick yourself intentionally, because you know you’re doing it.7 So you’ve got to be sneaky about it.

这提出了一个相当明显的解决方案：如果你想在X上工作，就告诉自己做Y。不幸的是，有意欺骗你自己是很难的，因为你知道你在做这件事。所以你要偷偷摸摸的。

One way is to get someone else to assign something to you. The most famous instance of this is grad students who are required to write a dissertation, a monumentally difficult task that they need to do to graduate. And so, to avoid doing this, grad students end up doing all sorts of other hard stuff.

一种方法是让别人给你分配一些东西。其中最着名的例子是毕业生，他们需要写论文，这是他们毕业所需要做的极其艰巨的任务。所以，为了避免这样做，毕业生最终会做各种其他的难题。

The task has to both seem important (you have to do this to graduate!) and big (hundreds of pages of your best work!) but not actually be so important that putting it off is going to be a disaster.

这个任务看起来很重要（你必须这样做才能毕业！）和巨大的（你最好的工作数百页），推迟去做看起来会是一场灾难但实际上并不那么重要。

#### Don’t assign problems to yourself 不要为自己分配问题
It’s very tempting to say “alright, I need to put all this aside, hunker down and finish this essay”. Even worse is to try to bribe yourself into doing something, like saying “alright, if I just finish this essay then I’ll go and eat some candy”. But the absolute worst of all is to get someone else to try to force you to do something.

说“好吧，我需要把这些放在一边，把这篇文章写下来。”是很有诱惑力但很糟糕，更糟的是试图贿赂自己做某事，比如说“好吧，如果我刚写完这篇文章，我就去吃点糖果”。但最糟糕的觉得是让其他人来强迫你做一些事情。

All of these are very tempting — I’ve done them all myself — but they’re completely counterproductive. In all three cases, you’ve basically assigned yourself a task. Now your brain is going to do everything it can to escape it.

这些看起来都是非常诱人的 - 我自己都做过 - 但是它们完全适得其反。在所有三种情况下，你基本上已经给自己分配了一个任务。现在你的大脑将尽其所能来逃避它。

#### Make things fun 让事情变得有趣
Hard work isn’t supposed to be pleasant, we’re told. But in fact it’s probably the most enjoyable thing I do. Not only does a tough problem completely absorb you while you’re trying to solve it, but afterwards you feel wonderful having accomplished something so serious.

我们被告知，辛勤工作不应该是愉快的。但事实上，这可能是我觉得的最愉快的事情。当你试图解决这个问题的时候，不仅是一个棘手的问题会完全吸收你，而且之后你会觉得完成了一件如此重要的事情是很有成就感的。

So the secret to getting yourself to do something is not to convince yourself you have to do it, but to convince yourself that it’s fun. And if it isn’t, then you need to make it fun.

所以让自己做点什么的秘诀不是说服自己必须做，而是要说服自己这很有趣。如果不是，那么你需要把它变得有趣。

I first got serious about this when I had to write essays for college. Writing essays isn’t a particularly hard task, but it sure is assigned. Who would voluntarily write a couple pages connecting the observations of two random books? So I started making the essays into my own little jokes. For one, I decided to write each paragraph in its own little style, trying my best to imitate various forms of speech. (This had the added benefit of padding things out.)

当我不得不为大学毕业写论文时，我首先认真对待这个问题。撰写论文不是一件特别困难的事情，但它确实是分配的任务。谁会自愿写几百页接近两本书厚的文字？于是我开始把这些论文写成自己的小笑话。所以首先，我决定用自己的小风格尽量模仿各种形式的言论去写下每一段标题。（这有额外的好处当填补东西进去的时候。）

Another way to make things more fun is to solve the meta-problem. Instead of building a web application, try building a web application framework with this as the example app. Not only will the task be more enjoyable, but the result will probably be more useful.

让事情更有趣的另一种方法是解决元问题。尝试构建一个Web应用程序框架作为示例应用程序，而不是构建Web应用程序。这项任务不仅会更愉快，而且结果可能会更有用。

#### Conclusion 结论

There are a lot of myths about productivity — that time is fungible, that focusing is good, that bribing yourself is effective, that hard work is unpleasant, that procrastinating is unnatural — but they all have a common theme: a conception of real work as something that goes against your natural inclinations.

关于生产力有很多（鸡汤）神话 - 时间是可以替代的，有重点是好的，贿赂自己是有效的，艰苦的工作是不愉快的，拖延是不自然的 - 但他们都有一个共同的主题：一些与实际工作的概念以及自然倾向相违背的东西。

And for most people, in most jobs, this may be the case. There’s no reason you should be inclined to write boring essays or file pointless memos. And if society is going to force you to do so anyway, then you need to learn to shut out the voices in your head telling you to stop.

对于大多数人来说，在大多数工作中，情况可能如此。没有理由你应该倾向于写无聊的文章或文件毫无意义的备忘录。如果社会要强迫你这样做，那么你需要学会拒绝你头上的声音。

But if you’re trying to do something worthwhile and creative, then shutting down your brain is entirely the wrong way to go. The real secret to productivity is the reverse: to listen to your body. To eat when you’re hungry, to sleep when you’re tired, to take a break when you’re bored, to work on projects that seem fun and interesting.

但是，如果你想要做一些有价值的创意，那么关掉你的大脑是完全错误的。生产力的真正秘密是相反的：倾听你的身体。饿的时候吃，疲劳的时候睡觉，当你无聊的时候休息一下，去做一些看起来有趣又有趣的项目。

It seems all too simple. It doesn’t involve any fancy acronyms or self-determination or personal testimonials from successful businessmen. It almost seems like common sense. But society’s conception of work has pushed us in the opposite direction. If we want to be more productive, all we need to do is turn around.

这似乎太简单了。它不涉及任何花哨的缩略语，自我决定或成功商人的个人推荐。这几乎是常识。但社会的工作理念却使我们走向相反的方向。如果我们要提高生产力，我们所要做的就是转身。

### Notes 注

- Believe it or not, I actually have written in subways. It’s easy to come up with excuses as to why you’re not actually working — you don’t have enough time before your next appointment, people are making noise downstairs, etc. — but I find that when the inspiration strikes me, I can actually write stuff down on a subway car, where it’s absurdly loud and I only have a couple minutes before I have to get out and start walking. 

- 信不信由你，我其实在地铁里写了这篇文章。关于为什么你不是真的在工作很容易就能找到一些借口 - 在下一次约会之前没有足够的时间，人们在楼下吵闹，等等。但是我发现当灵感来袭时，我实际上可以在地铁上写东西，那里很吵，并且我只有几分钟就要继续走了。

- The same problem exists for sleep. There’s nothing worse than being too tired to go to bed — you just feel like a zombie. 

- 同样的问题存在于睡眠。没有什么比太累再上床睡更糟 - 你只是觉得自己像个僵尸。

- Now it turns out I experience this same phenomenon in another area: shyness. I often don’t want to call a stranger up on the phone or go talk to someone at a party and I have the exact same mental field pushing me off in some other direction. I suspect this might be because shyness is also a trait that results from a problematic childhood. (See “Assigned problems”.) Of course, this is all very speculative. 

- 现在的事实证明，我在另一个领域遇到了同样的现象：害羞。我经常不想打电话给陌生人，也不想在聚会上和某个人谈话，我也有同样的精神领域，把我推向另一个方向。我怀疑这可能是因为害羞也是一个有问题的童年的特征。 （请参阅“指定问题一节”。）*当然，这是非常投机的。*

- While the terminology I use here (“next concrete step”) is derived from David Allen’s Getting Things Done, a lot of the principles here are (perhaps even unconsciously) applied in Extreme Programming (XP). Extreme Programming is presented as this system for keeping programs organized, but I find that a lot of it is actually good advice for avoid procrastination.

- 虽然我在这里使用的术语（“下一个具体步骤”）是从David Allen的Getting Things Done衍生出来的，但是这里的很多原理（甚至是无意识的）都可以应用到极限编程（XP）中。极限编程是为了保持程序组织而提供的，但我发现其中很多是避免拖延的好建议。

- For example, pair programming automatically spreads the mental weight of the task across two people as well as giving people something useful to do during lower-quality time. Breaking a project down into concrete steps is another key part of XP, as is getting something that works done right away and improving on it (“Simplify it” infra). And these are just the things that aren’t programming-specific. 

- 例如，结对编程会自动将任务的精神分散在两个人之间，同时也为人们在低质量的时间做一些有用的事情。将项目分解成具体的步骤是XP的另一个关键部分，就像获得立即完成的工作并改进它（下文简化它）。而这些只是那些不是特定于程序的东西。

- For a fantastic overview of the literature, see Alfie Kohn, Punished By Rewards. This specific claim is drawn from his article Challenging Behaviorist Dogma: Myths About Money and Motivation. 

- 关于文学的精彩概述，请参阅Alfie Kohn，惩罚奖励。这个具体的主张是从他的文章挑战行为主义教条：关于金钱和动机的神话。

- I originally simply assumed this was somehow biological, but Paul Graham pointed out it’s more likely learned. When you’re little, your parents try their best to manipulate you. They say do your homework and your mind tries to wriggle free and think about something else. Soon enough the wriggling becomes habit. Either way, it’s going to be a tough problem to fix. I’ve given up trying to change this; now I try to work around it. 

- 我原来只是假定这是某种生物，但是保罗·格雷厄姆指出，这很可能是学习的。当你小时候，你的父母会尽力操纵你。他们说，做你的功课，你的思想试图摆脱自由，思考别的东西。蠕动很快变成习惯。无论哪种方式，这将是一个棘手的问题来解决。我已经放弃了试图改变这一点;现在我尝试解决它。

- Richard Feynman tells a story about how he was trying to explore his own dreams, much the way I’ve tried to explore my own procrastination. Each night, he’d try to observe what happened to himself as he fell asleep:

- 理查德·费曼（Richard Feynman）讲述了他如何试图探索自己的梦想的故事，就像我试图探索自己的拖延一样。每天晚上，他都会试着观察自己在睡着时发生了什么事：

    - I’m dreaming one night as usual, making observations, … and then I realize I’ve been sleeping with the back of my head against a brass rod. I put my hand behind my head and I feel that the back of my head is soft. I think, “Aha! That’s why I’ve been able to make all these observations in my dreams: the brass rod has disturbed my visual cortex. All I have to do is sleep with a brass rod under my head and I can make these observations any time I want. So I think I’ll stop making observations on this one and go into deeper sleep.”

     - 我像往常一样梦想着一个晚上，做观察，然后我意识到我已经睡在我的头后面，反对黄铜棒。我把我的手放在头后面，我感到我的后脑是软的。我想，“啊哈！这就是为什么我能够在梦中做出所有这些观察：黄铜棒扰乱了我的视觉皮层。我所要做的就是睡在我头上的黄铜棒，我可以随时做出这些观察。所以我想我会停止对这个进行观察，进入更深的睡眠。“

    - When I woke up later, there was no brass rod, nor was the back of my head soft. Somehow … my brain had invented false reasons as to why I shouldn’t [observe my dreams] any more. (Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!)

     - 当我醒来后，没有黄铜棒，我的头也不软。不知何故......我的大脑已经发明了错误的理由，为什么我不应该再次观察我的梦想。 （当然你是开玩笑，费曼先生）

        - Your brain is a lot more powerful than you are. 

        - 你的大脑比你强大得多。

- So, for example, instead of writing “By contrast, Riis doesn’t quote many people.”, I wrote: “Riis, however, whether because of a personal deficit in the skill-based capacity required for collecting aurally-transmitted person-centered contemporaneous ethnographies into published paper-based informative accounts or simply a lack of preference for the reportage of community-located informational correspondents, demonstrates a total failure in producing a comparable result.”

- 所以，比如说，“Riis并没有引用很多人的话”，而是写了一句“没有引用很多人的意思”，而是写道：“Riis是否因为收集听觉传播的人所需要的基于技能的能力以同期的民族志为中心发布在纸质的信息报告中，或者仅仅是缺乏对社区信息记者报道的偏好，显示完全不能产生类似的结果。

- The professor, apparently seriously desensitized to bad writing, never seemed to realize I was joking (despite going over the paper with me one-on-one!). 

- 教授显然严重地对写作不敏感，似乎从来没有意识到我在开玩笑（尽管我一对一地和我一起阅读）。
